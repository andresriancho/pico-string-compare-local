## String comparison
This repository holds very simple code snippets that compare two strings 
in different languages .

The code is written in such a way that it is easy to measure if there is
a time side-channel in the string comparison implementation.

## Pico
The code in this repository is just a small part of a bigger research I'm
doing on timing attacks. More info and a tool can be found in
[pico's repository](https://github.com/andresriancho/pico).

## Output
The raw output of my tests are saved in the `output` directory using CSV format.

An easy to read summary of the data can be found
[here](https://github.com/andresriancho/pico/wiki/String-comparison-analysis).

## Languages
 * Python 2.7
