## String comparison scripts for pico
This repository holds very simple code snippets in different languages that compare two strings.

The code is written in such a way that it is easy to measure if there is a time side-channel in the
string comparison implementation of each language.

## Pico
The code in this repository is just a small part of a bigger research I'm doing on timing attacks.
More info and a tool can be found in [pico's repository](https://github.com/andresriancho/pico).
